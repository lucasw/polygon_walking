polygonal approximation to walking in pygame

http://www2.cs.siu.edu/~hexmoor/classes/CS404-S09/RobotLocomotion.pdf :

"the human bipedal walking can be approximated as a rolling polygon with sides equal in length d to the span of the step, as figure 2 shows. Decreasing the step size means, that the polygon approaches a wheel, of course there is no actively powered wheel, which is needed for wheeled locomotion, in the nature."

This has a matplotlib based version:
