Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots (2nd edition?).  There are pdfs on the web of a 2004 edition, but the edX AMRx course has a newer edition.

"the human bipedal walking can be approximated as a rolling polygon with sides equal in length d to the span of the step, as figure 2 shows. Decreasing the step size means, that the polygon approaches a wheel, of course there is no actively powered wheel, which is needed for wheeled locomotion, in the nature."

This has a matplotlib based version:
